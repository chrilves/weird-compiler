WC, The Weird Compiler
=======================

- System requirements:
----------------------

 o ocaml
 o ocamlbuild
 o TeX
 o pdftex (to run tests)
 o make
 o conTeXt (for documentation)
 o menhir  (to compile to obrowser)

- Compile :
-----------

 Simply type "make bin"


- Documentation :
-----------------

Simply type "make doc" to generate the file "manual.pdf".

/!\ IF YOU GET THE ERROR MESSAGE "contex.lua not found" or "base.lua not found"
ON ARCH LINUX, TYPE

sudo sed -i "s|selfautoparent:|/usr/share/|g" "/usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmfcnf.lua"

THEN IT MIGHT WORK.


- Examples and Tests :
----------------------

 Examples are in the "examples" folder. To
compile example you can either:

 - You can type "make test" from "WC" directory.
 - Go into directoy "examples/first" and type "make"


- Using :
---------

"./wc.native" can be run without arguments to
prints help.

"./wc.native -t -i toto.wc -o toto.tex" compiles
the file "toto.wc" and output the result into file
"toto.tex". "toto.tex" can be compiled by regular
tex/pdftex.



- Online :
----------

 To use the "Online" version, simply type:

make owc

 to compile and visit "dist/owc/index.html" with
 your favorite browser (it works best with Firefox).
 For example:


make owc && firefox ./dist/owc/index.html

 will open firefox with OWC.
